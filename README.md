# Titanic_Survival_Prediction

## 1.Context

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

## 2.Dataset Overview:


The data has been split into two groups: training set (train.csv) test set (test.csv)

The training set should be used to build our machine learning models. Our model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. we can also use feature engineering to create new features.

The test set should be used to see how well our model performs on unseen data.


## What to predict:

For each passenger in the test set,Our model will be trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.
